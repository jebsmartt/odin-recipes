    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Cornbread is a great accompaniment to any menu. It's a tasty bread option and is good for gathering up juices from stews and gravies. Many African and and Afro-diasporic cuisines use a low-cost starchy item to stretch out meals and gather up gravies from other dishes. West Africa has fufu and garri, East Africa has ugali and injera, and the Carolinas have rice.
